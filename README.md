README

Versioning system is defined by three numbers: 0.2.5
* The first number, 0, is a major release. These are huge milestones and will require end users to possibly update their game files (e.g., backwards compatibility is not guaranteed).
* The second number, 2, is a minor release. These are new features or improvements to existing ones.
* The third number, 5, designated a bug fix release.
